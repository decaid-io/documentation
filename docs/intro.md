## Developing NFT Application used to be Hard, Slow and Expensive 🤯
### Blockchain stack is complex 😣
Grasping Solidity, Web3.js, GraphQL, nodes, IPFS, data-intensive applications, etc. is hard, time-consuming and usually needs a team to cover all of the skills!

### Data classification, ETLs or etc. is taking too much time 🥵
Data classification is a hard task, and it takes a lot of time to do. You need a team for each blockchain network, and each network has its own data classification. This is madness!

### Non-infrastructure first providers are a risky bet 🎰
Using heavily rate-limited APIs is risky because if the service provider is not an infrastructure first company, they can change their business strategy and limit or turn off their APIs, leaving your project being shut down.

### Speed matters in this market 🚀
Being leapfrogged by the competition in a fast moving NFT market is one of the top worries for many. Slow-to-deploy and -use APIs will hinder your go-to-market, thus you risk losing users, revenue and being displaced by the competition.
