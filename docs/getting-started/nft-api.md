# NFT API 
Decaid's NFT API is a powerful tool that enables you to mint, deploy, and call smart contracts. Allows you to quickly get all the information you need to know about NFTs from the blockchain(i.e Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain). Rather than searching, indexing, and storing data yourself - you can now make one request to fetch specific NFT information for both ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens like;

- All NFTs owned by an address
- Metadata and attributes for a specific NFT token.

## What can I make?
Using the Decaid NFT API allows you to both fetch and display NFTs for your users, making it easy to build and kinds of NFT projects. To take some inspiration from existing products, here are some examples you can explore:

- NFT Marketplace
- Build on-chain NFT Games
- Verify Ownership of Digital Assets
- Social NFT Displays
- Build a game inventory system
